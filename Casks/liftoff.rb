  caveats <<~EOS
    Liftoff is not notarized yet. The first time you open it, macOS blocks it:
    open System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down and click "Open Anyway".
    Window previews need Screen & System Audio Recording; Accessibility is optional.
    Updating from 1.2.0 asks you to allow them once more; from 1.2.1 on, updates keep them.
    If Liftoff is missing from the Screen & System Audio Recording list, click +
    below the list and choose /Applications/Liftoff.app.
